orbit-vm is a project started by 2 students of the University College KHK Kempen Geel in Belgium. These guys are Jorge Schrauwen and Erwin Staepelaere.

It's aim is to provide an open source, cross-platform GUI for managing vSphere 4 servers.

We've reached our goal.
Orbit-VM is now capable of starting, stopping and restarting existing Virtual Machines.
Basic information is also displayed.

If there is interest in this project, we may continue expanding it with new features.
